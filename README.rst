A `Tailwind CSS`_ template pack for the wonderful django-crispy-forms_.

**WARNING**

This project is still in its early stages of development. Any contributions to
the package would be very welcomed.

Currently the template pack allows the use of the ``|crispy`` filter to style
your form. Here is an example image.

How to install
--------------

Install via pip. ::

    pip install crispy-tailwind

You will need to update your project's settings file to add ``crispy_forms``
and ``crispy_tailwind`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. Also set
``tailwind`` as an allowed template pack and as the default template pack
for your project::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "crispy_forms",
        "crispy_tailwind",
        ...
    )

    CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "tailwind"

    CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "tailwind"

How to use
----------

This project is still in its early stages.

Current functionality allows the ``|crispy`` filter to be used to style your
form. In your template:

1. Load the filter: ``{% load tailwind_filters %}``
2. Apply the crispy filter: ``{{ form|crispy }}``

We can also use the ``{% crispy %}`` tag to allow usage of crispy-forms'
``FormHelper`` and ``Layout``. In your template:

1. Load the crispy tag: ``{% load crispy_forms_tags %}``
2. Add ``FormHelper`` to your form and use crispy-forms to set-up your form
3. Use the crispy tag ``{% crispy form %}`` in your template

FAQs
----

What about custom widgets?
==========================

The template pack includes default styles for widgets included in Django 
itself. `Styling of widget instances`_ can be done by using the ``widget.attrs``
argument when creating the widget.

For example the following form will render 
``<input type="text" name="name" class="customtextwidget custom-css" required id="id_name">``::

    class CustomTextWidget(forms.TextInput):
        pass

    class CustomTextWidgetForm(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField(
            widget=CustomTextWidget(attrs={"class": "custom-css"})
        )
