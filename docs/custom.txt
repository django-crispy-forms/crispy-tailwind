Custom Styles
=============

With Tailwind being a utility framework there is much more ability to customise
your site than with many of the other CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.

While our opinionated Tailwind styles may get you so far you may wish to change these.

The Tailwind template pack aims to help you customise your form in a DRY way. This
template pack comes with a utility class called `CSSContainer` which can be attached to your
form helper.

CSSContainer

`CSSContainer` is imported from `crispy_tailwind.tailwind`. This is a class which holds the
CSS style for your form. Currently it holds the classes for the `<input>` tags within your form.
The class expects a dict of Django widgets and class styles::

    >>> from crispy_tailwind.tailwind import CSSContainer

    >>> css = CSSContainer({
        "text": "border border-gray-300",
        "number": "border border-gray-300",
        ...
    })

As there are many Django widgets, there is the option to pass in classes to a "base" key
which will then be applied to all of the widgets::

    >>> css = CSSContainer({
        "base": "bg-white"
    })
    >>> css
    {
    'text': 'bg-white',
    'number': 'bg-white',
    'email': 'bg-white',
    ...
    }

You can also update add and remove styles::

    >>> css += {
        "text": "text more styles",
        "number": "number style"
    }
    >>> css
    {
    'text': 'bg-white text more styles',
    'number': 'bg-white number style',
    'email': 'bg-white',
    ...
    }
    >>> css -= {
    "text": "bg-white",
    "number": "bg-white"
    }
    >>> css
    {
    'text': 'text more styles',
    'number': 'number style',
    'email': 'bg-white',
    ...
    }
