Getting Started

Installation
============

Install via pip. ::

    pip install crispy-tailwind

You will need to update your project's settings file to add ``crispy_forms``
and ``crispy_tailwind`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Also set
``tailwind`` as and allowed template pack and as the default template pack for
your project::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "crispy_forms",
        "crispy_tailwind",
        ...
    )

    CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "tailwind"

    CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "tailwind"

Usage
=====

There are a number of ways you can use ``crispy-tailwind``. The simplest way
is to use the ``|crispy`` filter. This will add an opinionated `Tailwind` style
to your form. If you require more control you can use the ``crispy`` tags and
utilise the full power of the ``crispy-forms`` through it's ``FormHelper`` and
``Layout`` capabilities.

`|crispy` filter
----------------

The crispy filter is the simpler way to add `Tailwind` style to your form. It
avoids the complexity of ``FormHelper`` and it comes with an opinionated form
style.

1. Load the ``tailwind_filters`` in your template::

    {% load tailwind_filters %}

2. Apply the ``|crispy`` filter to your form::

    {{ form|crispy }}

Here are two examples. The first shows the default rendering, the second shows
rendering of server side errors:

.. image:: img/crispy_form.png
   :width: 49%
.. image:: img/crispy_failing.png
   :width: 49%

`{% crispy %}` tags
-------------------
