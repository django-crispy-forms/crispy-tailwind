Getting Started
===============

Installation
============

Install via pip. ::

    pip install crispy-tailwind

You will need to update your project's settings file to add ``crispy_forms``
and ``crispy_tailwind`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. Also set
``tailwind`` as an allowed template pack and as the default template pack for
your project::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "crispy_forms",
        "crispy_tailwind",
        ...
    )

    CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "tailwind"

    CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "tailwind"

If you use `Tailwind CLI <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation>`_, you have to provide the path to your
templates. Since this package contains templates which are within your Pythons `site-packages`, it's hard to tell
Tailwind where these templates live.

Thanks to Carlton Gibson's blog, you can implement (aka copy & paste) a Django management command and the corresponding
Tailwind configuration:

Usage
=====

There are a number of ways you can use ``crispy-tailwind``. The method
requiring the least amount of effort involves using the ``|crispy`` filter.
This will add an opinionated `Tailwind` style to your form. If you require more
control, you can use the ``crispy`` tags and utilise the full power of the
``crispy-forms`` through its ``FormHelper`` and ``Layout`` capabilities.

``|crispy`` filter
------------------

The ``|crispy`` filter is the method requiring the least amount of effort to
add `Tailwind` style to your form. It avoids the complexity of ``FormHelper``,
and it comes with an opinionated form style.

1. Load the ``tailwind_filters`` in your template::

    {% load tailwind_filters %}

2. Apply the ``|crispy`` filter to your form::

    {{ form|crispy }}

Here are two examples. The first shows the default rendering. The second shows
rendering of server-side errors:

.. image:: img/crispy_form.png
   :width: 49%
.. image:: img/crispy_failing.png
   :width: 49%

``{% crispy %}`` tags
---------------------

Using the ``{% crispy %}`` tag allows you to use the core crispy-form_
functionality.

1. Load the crispy tag: ``{% load crispy_forms_tags %}``
2. Add ``FormHelper`` to your form and use crispy-forms to configure your form.
3. Use the crispy tag ``{% crispy form %}`` in your template.

This will render a form with the same opinionated style as the ``|crispy``
filter.

The classes are largely held in a ``CSSContainer`` class. This can be changed
to meet your needs. Docs and functionality for this area continue to be
developed.

Crispy-addon
============

There is a template tag called ``crispy-addon``. It can be used to render a
single field (including label) with prepended and appended text::

    {% load tailwind_field %}
    {% crispy_addon form.my_field prepend="$" append=".00" %}

You can also prepend or append like so::

    {% crispy_addon form.my_field prepend="$" %}
    {% crispy_addon form.my_field append=".00" %}
