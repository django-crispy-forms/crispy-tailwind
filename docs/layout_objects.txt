Layout Objects
==============

This template pack renders Django widgets with the Tailwind CSS framework. This
page shows examples of how these widgets look when rendered with the default
styling. For these objects we have given an opinion on how they should look.

If you are using the ``|crispy`` filter the form will be styled using the
default layout. If you wish to customise the form you can use ``{% crispy %}``
tags and ``FormHelper`` to control the layout of your form.

Wherever possible layout objects are used from ``crispy-forms`` itself (either
core or bootstrap). Where these can not be used Tailwind versions are included
within this template pack. This means that the layout objects may be found
within one of three files.

- ``crispy_forms.layout`` (``Layout`` and other standard objects)
- ``crispy_forms.bootstrap`` (Some bootstrap objects work out of the box, so we
  will use these)
- ``crispy_tailwind.layout`` (Customised versions for Tailwind are found here)

Knowledge for crispy-forms ``Layout`` class is assumed. Please see
https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layouts.html for further
information.

The following layout objects can be imported from ``crispy_tailwind.layout``.

Buttons
-------

The three Buttons (``Button``, ``Reset`` and ``Submit``) from ``crispy-forms``
have been customised for the Tailwind template pack. Below is an example form
layout with an image showing how it is rendered::

  form.helper.layout = Layout(
      ButtonHolder(Button("button", "Button"), Submit("submit", "Submit",), Reset("cancel", "Cancel"))
  )

   :height: 35px

The three buttons have default classes applied to them. The buttons can all be
customised by adding css_classes to these layout objects. The following layout
renders a single customised ``Submit`` button::

  form.helper.layout = Layout(Submit("submit", "Submit", css_class="bg-transparent hover:bg-blue-500 text-blue-700 font-semibold hover:text-white py-2 px-4 border border-blue-500 hover:border-transparent rounded"))
