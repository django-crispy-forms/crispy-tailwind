Layout Objects
==============

This template pack renders Django widgets with the Tailwind CSS framework. This
page shows examples of how these widgets look when rendered with the default
styling. For these objects we have given an opinion on how they should look.

If you are using the ``|crispy`` filter the form will be styled using the
default layout. If you wish to customise the form you can use ``{% crispy %}``
tags and ``FormHelper`` to control the layout of your form.

Wherever possible layout objects are used from ``crispy-forms`` itself (either
core or bootstrap). Where these can not be used Tailwind versions are included
within this template pack. This means that the layout objects may be found
within one of three files.

- ``crispy_forms.layout`` (``Layout`` and other standard objects)
- ``crispy_forms.bootstrap`` (Some bootstrap objects work out of the box, so we
  will use these)
- ``crispy_tailwind.layout`` (Customised versions for Tailwind are found here)

Knowledge for crispy-forms ``Layout`` class is assumed. Please see
https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layouts.html for further
information.

crispy_forms.layout
===================

Layout
------

The core Layout_ class which provides the ability to control the rendering of your form. This is the parent which will
wrap individual layout objects.

.. _Layout: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layouts.html?#fundamentals

Column
------

The Column_ layout object wraps fields in a ``div`` so it can be used as a
column. The Tailwind template adds no css class to this wrapper by default. If
required classes can be added::

  Column('form_field_1', 'form_field_2', css_class='additional classes',)

.. _column: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_layout.html?#layout.Column

Row
---

The Row_ layout object wraps fields in a ``div`` so it can be used as a
row. The Tailwind template adds ``flex flex-row`` to this wrapper by default.
If required this default can be replaced by custom css classes::

  Row('form_field_1', 'form_field_2', css_class='additional classes',)

Row and Column layouts are typically used together. Here is an example layout
with an image showing how the form is rendered::

  Row(
    Column(Field("first_name"), Field("last_name"), css_class="px-2"),
    Column("email", css_class="px-2"),
  )

.. image:: img/row_col.png
    :width: 50%

.. _Row : https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_layout.html?#layout.Row

Field
-----

The Field_ layout object allows attributes to be easily added to a single
field.

.. _Field: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_layout.html?#layout.Field

Div
---

The Div_ layout object wraps fields in a `Div`. No classes are added by default.

.. _Div: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_layout.html?#layout.Div

HTML
----

Used to render pure HTML code and behaves like a Django template. See the django-crispy-forms HTML_ docs for more
information.

The HTML_: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layouts.html?#universal-layout-objects

.. _HTML:

Hidden
------

Used to create a hidden_ input.

.. _Hidden: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_layout.html?#layout.Hidden

Fieldset
--------

Wraps fields in a ``<fieldset>``. The first parameter is the legend for the
fieldset. By default the class for the legend is
``block text-gray-700 font-bold mb-2``. Below is an example layout and the
default rendering::

  Fieldset("Text for the legend", "is_company", "email",)

.. image:: img/fieldset.png
    :width: 50%

If you wish to customise the legend please over ride the template. See the
`over riding layout objects templates`_ docs for guidance on how to do this.

.. _`over riding layout objects templates`: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layouts.html?#overriding-layout-objects-templates
.. _Fieldset: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_layout.html?#layout.Fieldset

Multifield, MultiWidgetField

crispy_forms.bootstrap
======================

The following objects can be imported from ``crispy_forms.boostrap``.


Prepended and Appended
----------------------

The three layout objects which allow for prepended and appended inputs are:

- ``PrependedText``. First argument is the field name, the second is the
  prepended text.
- ``AppendedText``. First argument is the field name, the second is the
  appended text.
- ``PrependedAppendedText``. A combined prepended and appended text. The first
  parameter is the name of the field, then second is the prepended text and
  thirdly the appended text.

The image below shows examples of how these are rendered with the template
provided with ``crispy-tailwind``. If you wish to customise these then you
will need to `over ride templates`_.

.. image:: img/prepended.png
    :width: 50%

See the ``crispy-forms`` Prepended_ docs for more information on how to use
these fields.

Note: the active argument does not have any impact on the ``crispy-tailwind``
template pack.

.. _Prepended: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layouts.html?#bootstrap-layout-objects

crispy_tailwind.layout
======================

The following layout objects can be imported from ``crispy_tailwind.layout``.

Buttons
-------

The three Buttons (``Button``, ``Reset`` and ``Submit``) from ``crispy-forms``
have been customised for the Tailwind template pack. Below is an example form
layout with an image showing how it is rendered::

  form.helper.layout = Layout(
      ButtonHolder(Button("button", "Button"), Submit("submit", "Submit",), Reset("cancel", "Cancel"))
  )

.. image:: img/Buttons.png
   :height: 35px

The three buttons have default classes applied to them. The buttons can all be
customised by adding css_classes to these layout objects. The following layout
renders a single customised ``Submit`` button::

  form.helper.layout = Layout(Submit("submit", "Submit", css_class="bg-transparent hover:bg-blue-500 text-blue-700 font-semibold hover:text-white py-2 px-4 border border-blue-500 hover:border-transparent rounded"))

.. image:: img/custom_button.png
   :height: 35px

Alert
-----

Renders an alert message box::

        form.helper.layout = Layout(
            Alert(content="<strong>Warning!</strong> Here's a test message.")
        )

.. image:: img/alert.png
  :height: 50px

The ``css_class`` argument can be used to change the default classes on the
wrapping ``<div>``, this allows simple changes to the alert style (e.g. colour)
.

By default alerts have a close button. To disable, set ``dismiss`` to
``false``.

In addition the variety of alerts possible with Tailwind is wide and but may
require a different HTML layout. In this case you may find is useful to over
ride the ``alert.html`` template. See the crispy-forms docs on how to
`over ride templates`_ for more information.
